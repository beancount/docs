-------------------------------

[<span class="underline">reds importers</span>](https://github.com/redstreet/beancount_reds_importers): Simple importers and tools, mostly ofx based and built on top of \`ofxparse\`.

The goal is to factor out importer code into well maintained common libraries for banks, credit cards, and investment houses, to minimize institution specific code and make writing new importers easy. Look inside the importers/ directory to see a list of institutions supported. More investment, credit card, and banking institutions will be added in the future. Contributions welcome.
